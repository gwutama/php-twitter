PHP Twitter is a PHP5-strict object-oriented twitter library which uses the Twitter API described in http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation. Currently, all API methods are implemented and can be used.

This library depends on PEAR HTTP_Request and XML_Serializer. Please make sure that these libraries are installed on your server.

Developed by Galuh Utama <galuh.utama@gwutama.de>. Drop me a line if you like PHP Twitter or if you find any bugs.

This library is licensed under GPL v3.


USAGE

Example:
<?php

require_once("Twitter.php");
require_once("Methods/Status.php");

$result = $twitter->friendsTimeline();
print_r($result);

?>
